- 👋 Hi, I’m @pedrostclair, from Cape Town, South Africa. I'm a skateboarder,
     Tourist Guide and recently began my 'coding-journey', which I've been
     Interested in for a while.

- 👀 Also, I'm interested in the fascinating world of quantum computing. 
     Uncertain if It's the unnecessary difficulty level? Or the 
     over-complicated mathematics, which I'll probably never understand.
     fun-times either way.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much my brain can process, poor thing.

- 💞️ Looking to collaborate on pretty much everything really, mainly here to learn.
     Lets make magic.
